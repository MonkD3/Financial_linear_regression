# Financial_linear_regression
This repo is for educational purpose and is still in progress, I write it to learn the basics of AI using TensorFlow
and use it in the Trading world, using real data. I hope you can benefit from it, or that you'll learn something.

## What I intend to do :

I hope to be able to make a clean IPython Notebook explaining the basics of Technical Analysis (Trading world) 
and linear regression model (AI) in both French and English, I'll first make it in French as it is my first language
but when it is finished, I'll translate it into english. When this is done I intend to make a basic Python program 
based on the code in the Notebook (a better version I hope) that you could run using your Own API key to get some new data.
